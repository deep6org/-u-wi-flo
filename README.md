Project: uflo & wiflo :: a local to global integrative mindful computing practice.
goal: seed more people in calm computing states. 

uflo :: a custom binaural neural feedback experience, run on a portable raspberry pi or PC connected to a blueberryx headset using fNIRS fed into an audio synthesis server.
goal: enhance the physical-cognitive connectivity through local environment loops.

wiflo :: interface for decentralized identity, aura identification & spiritual practice
goal: reduce global-separateness of aural agents and imprint new wide spread biographical memory via meditation experiences & guides

Current Status :: In experimentation and development. Work on wiflo is prioritized over uflo.

Introduction :: The tools are meant to make aware through polarities our non-dual presence, using familiar & available interfaces of technology, the nature of centerlessness. The aim is to find a compromise between the Technologist Alchemist & Traditional Divinity using simplified UI taste & design, while being accessible for on-ramping mindfulness seekers into the ecosystem via meditation (spirit) or code (logic).

Problem :: Normal turing based computers are based on physical deterministic processes. In meditation & mind rituals, this is largely driven by consciousness, deemed non-deterministic. The integration aims at new design experiments, rituals, & collaboration to minimize virtual connectivity while maximizing physical presence.
uflo Background
Device Design : Somewhere between an e-ink kindle & touch phone, like a pokedex but for our world - to capture thoughts, privately, on a walk. Producing a single copy of memories to share once connected, if need be with a level of pseudo-anonymity. Ultimately, a hardware extension that augments the embodied, not so much as a void / hole for attention capture. Enabling agents of reflexivity.
Abstract Simplicity : While many are focusing on complex synthesis of sounds, this project aims to systematically use unitized audio signals as a digital catalyst for rotational perspective shifts when meditating, going for a walk, or, as an overlay to any experience.
Binaural Beats : An auditory illusion by way of different frequencies in either ear to simulate a new sound perceived which is not presented. Cognitive advantages for such states can improve frequency detection i.e. perceptual learning. By tuning ones perceptual learning capability in real time, one can increase their subjective experience of novelty when connecting with nature, learning a new skill, unlearning habits, or boosting mindfulness.
Cybernetics : The scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.
Quantum Cognition : The tool is meant to simulate a Hadamard gate used in quantum computing, but for ones mind. Hadamard gates create a superposition point between 2 basis states (e.g. frequencies) whereby one is able to expand the possibilities of environmental navigation through optimal perceptual learning and action. The concept: in an increasingly connected mind, practice holding competing trajectories of thought to aid in empathetic decision making.
Philosophy
open source human cognition enhancements
the greater the collective synchrony, the more mindful we can be for designing systems in the long run
Possible Modes of Play
Composed: Adding sound dimensions for optimal composition supported via scynth audio server
Single: Following single signal trajectory tuned via reinforcement agent to neurofeedback
Multiplayer: p2p connected soundscape for group / global meditative / practice (wiflo)
wiflo Background
wiflo is an interface ‘about us’, to practice what's common, and a take on global decentralized identity, by focusing on value affinity.

Question : What might a neuroeconomy look like, with 'auras' as public views?

Techno-Spiritual : User adoption will be online. Build an interface that combines the use of a creator economy, mindfulness, and spiritual exploration into something that can be tried, integrated, & replicated. Aiding in new-religion & decentralized movements.

Design: Approach mindfulness as distributed ‘rooms’ for brain-computer interfaces that can share data in community settings, contributing mind towards the ideologies users value. 

Meta-Psychology: Using internet communication & processes as an autonomous process for self-curating communities and bci entry points to inform new forms of psychology. Possible use in archives & understanding VR ideologies, gaming environments, etc.

Hypothesis: Filecoin as a data adapter to bci’s for representing a model of global efficient data access at a reduction in cost via market primitives for closer to natural outcomes when modelling cognition of agent-environment interaction in longevity research.
